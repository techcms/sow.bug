With MongoPress, it is possible to run all the administrative options from
the front-end of the installation. To do so, you simply need an index.php file
within the theme, that points to the various pages.

An example of this is provided with the default theme.

There should be a file called index-sample.php - simply rename this to index.php
and start accessing administrative functions directly from your theme...
